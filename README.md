## Instructions to run and test CUDiningPair
Currently for iteration1, we have three main functions: register, login, and filter database.

1. First loading the app will direct us to the login page. There you can click “Sign up here” and move on to the registration page(assuming that you don't have an account already).

2. To register, you will write your uni and password(twice for confirmation) to sign up. You click “Sign up” and you will get a verification code through your email(your_uni@columbia.edu)

3. Successfully verified user will be redirected to the login page. To start using our app, you can login. 

4. After logging in user will be on welcome page where they can click “restaurant” to move onto restaurant database. In restaurant page, user can add restaurant data and filter their view.
