## Instructions to run and test CUDiningPair
Currently for iteration1 we have three main functions.

There you will write your uni and password to sign up. Once you click “Sign up”, you will get a verification code through your email and verify yourself.

2. Successfully verified user will be redirected to the login page. 

3. After logging in user will be on welcome page where they can click “restaurant” to move onto restaurant database. In restaurant page, user can add restaurant data and filter their view.
